# SQL
In the music store folder, I have added the screenshot of a guided project SQL project to analyze online music store data.  The link for the project is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFIuIjswMKM&ab_channel=RishabhMishra. 

Use various commands and statements to retrieve, manipulate, and manage data within a relational database like GROUP BY, JOIN, SUBQUERY, CTE and etc. 

The database and Tools used are Postgre SQL and PgAdmin4.
